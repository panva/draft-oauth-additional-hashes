1.  Introduction

   Several OAuth 2.0 mechanisms exclusively mandate the use of SHA-256:
   Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) [RFC7636], mutual-TLS certificate-
   bound access tokens [RFC8705], and Demonstrating Proof of Possession
   (DPoP) [RFC9449].

   Security policies, such as the US Commercial National Security
   Algorithm (CNSA 2.0) Suite [cnsafaq], prohibit the use of SHA-256 and
   require SHA-384 or SHA-512.  This prevents the deployment of these
   OAuth 2.0 mechanisms in such environments.

   This document addresses this gap by defining SHA-512 alternatives for
   each of these mechanisms, for use in deployments operating under such
   constrained policies.  For PKCE, a new S512 code challenge method is
   defined.  For mutual-TLS certificate-bound access tokens, a new
   x5t#S512 confirmation method is defined.  For DPoP, this document
   defines SHA-512 alternatives for the JWK Thumbprint confirmation
   method (jkt#S512) and the access token hash claim (ath#S512), as well
   as an extensible framework for authorization code binding and access
   token hash algorithm negotiation.

   [[TODO: The hash algorithm chosen by this document is currently SHA-
   512.  The working group should determine whether to define SHA-384 or
   SHA-512.]]

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   All references to "CNSA 2.0" in this document refer to CNSA 2.0
   [cnsafaq], unless stated otherwise.

3.  Purpose and Scope

   The sole purpose of this document is to enable deployments operating
   under security policies that prohibit SHA-256 to use PKCE, mutual-TLS
   certificate-bound access tokens, and DPoP.  In such constrained
   deployments, the SHA-512 alternatives defined herein are used in
   place of their SHA-256 counterparts, since those deployments cannot
   use SHA-256 at all.

   This document does not deprecate the SHA-256 based methods defined in
   existing specifications.  The SHA-256 based methods remain the widely
   deployed, interoperable and recommended defaults for all mechanisms
   addressed by this document.  Deployments that are not subject to such
   security policies SHOULD NOT offer or use the SHA-512 based methods
   defined herein.

   The negotiation mechanisms defined herein may however facilitate a
   broader transition away from SHA-256 in the future, should that
   become necessary.

4.  PKCE

   Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) [RFC7636] defines plain and S256
   as code challenge methods, with S256 being the only method that
   applies a cryptographic hash to the code verifier.  The specification
   establishes the "PKCE Code Challenge Methods" registry, which this
   document uses to register the S512 code challenge method.

4.1.  S512 Code Challenge Method

   This document defines a new code challenge method for use with PKCE
   [RFC7636].  The client creates a code challenge derived from the code
   verifier by using the following transformation on the code verifier:

   S512:  code_challenge = BASE64URL(SHA-512(ASCII(code_verifier)))

   The server-side verification of the code verifier follows Section 4.6
   of [RFC7636], using SHA-512 as the hash algorithm.

4.2.  Authorization Server Metadata

   An Authorization Server that supports the S512 code challenge method
   MUST advertise its support in its Authorization Server metadata
   (e.g., [RFC8414] or [OpenID.Discovery]) by including S512 in the
   code_challenge_methods_supported metadata parameter value as defined
   in [RFC8414].

5.  Mutual-TLS

   OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound
   Access Tokens [RFC8705] exclusively uses SHA-256 for certificate-
   bound access tokens via the x5t#S256 confirmation method.  No
   alternative hash algorithms or extension points for hash algorithm
   negotiation are defined.  This document defines the x5t#S512
   confirmation method and a Resource Server metadata parameter for
   negotiating the confirmation method.

5.1.  x5t#S512 Confirmation Method

   RFC 8705 [RFC8705] defines the x5t#S256 confirmation method member
   for binding access tokens to a client certificate using a SHA-256
   hash of the DER-encoded X.509 certificate.

   This document defines an analogous confirmation method member
   x5t#S512 that uses SHA-512 as the hash algorithm:

   x5t#S512:  The value is a base64url-encoded SHA-512 hash of the DER
      encoding of the X.509 certificate.

   When using x5t#S512, the Authorization Server computes the SHA-512
   hash of the client certificate presented during mutual-TLS and
   includes the result as the x5t#S512 member of the cnf claim in the
   access token (for JWT access tokens) or associates it with the token
   for later retrieval via token introspection [RFC7662].

   The Resource Server MUST compute the SHA-512 hash of the client
   certificate presented during mutual-TLS and compare it with the
   x5t#S512 value in the cnf claim.  If the values do not match, the
   Resource Server MUST reject the request.

   The choice of x5t#S512 over x5t#S256 is a deployment decision.  It
   can be configured out of band or by the Authorization Server using
   the Resource Server's metadata (Section 5.2).

   [[TODO: Section 3.1 of [RFC7800] does not preclude the presence of
   both x5t#S256 and x5t#S512 in the same cnf claim.  Including both
   would not represent confirmations for two different keys but rather
   two different hash confirmations of the same certificate.  This may
   actually be useful during a transition period in possible future non-
   constrained deployment scenarios.  The working group should determine
   whether to prohibit or allow this.]]

5.2.  Resource Server Metadata

   This document defines the mtls_confirmation_methods_supported
   Resource Server metadata parameter [RFC9728].  Its value is a JSON
   array containing the mutual-TLS confirmation method names that the
   Resource Server supports.  Defined values are x5t#S256 and x5t#S512.
   If omitted, the default is ["x5t#S256"].

6.  DPoP

   OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) [RFC9449]
   exclusively uses SHA-256 for all of its hash operations: the jkt
   confirmation method, the ath access token hash claim, and the
   dpop_jkt authorization code binding parameter.  No alternative hash
   algorithms or extension points for hash algorithm negotiation are
   defined.

   Section 11.10 of [RFC9449] anticipated the need for hash algorithm
   agility and foresaw that a future specification would define a new
   confirmation method, JWT claim, and authorization request parameter
   for use as alternatives to their SHA-256 counterparts.  This document
   defines those DPoP mechanisms: the dpop_jkt_method authorization
   request parameter, the jkt#S512 confirmation method, and the ath#S512
   JWT claim.  In constrained deployments where SHA-256 is prohibited,
   these are used in place of their SHA-256 counterparts rather than
   alongside them.

6.1.  Authorization Code Binding Methods

6.1.1.  dpop_jkt_method Authorization Request Parameter

   RFC 9449 [RFC9449] defines the dpop_jkt authorization request
   parameter as the JWK Thumbprint [RFC7638] of the DPoP public key
   using SHA-256.  This document changes the definition of dpop_jkt to
   allow alternative hash algorithms indicated by the dpop_jkt_method
   parameter.

   This document defines the dpop_jkt_method authorization request
   parameter, sent alongside dpop_jkt, to indicate the hash algorithm
   used to compute the JWK Thumbprint.  The following method values are
   defined:

   S256:  JWK Thumbprint [RFC7638] using SHA-256, as originally defined
      in Section 10 of [RFC9449].

   S512:  JWK Thumbprint [RFC7638] using SHA-512.

   For backwards compatibility, when dpop_jkt_method is absent from the
   authorization request, the Authorization Server MUST assume the value
   S256.

   The value of dpop_jkt MUST be computed using the hash algorithm
   indicated by dpop_jkt_method.

6.1.2.  Authorization Server Metadata

   This document defines the dpop_jkt_methods_supported Authorization
   Server metadata parameter.  Its value is a JSON array containing the
   dpop_jkt_method values that the Authorization Server supports.

   An Authorization Server that supports dpop_jkt_method values beyond
   S256 MUST advertise its support by including the supported values in
   the dpop_jkt_methods_supported metadata parameter.

6.2.  SHA-512 Hash Algorithms

6.2.1.  jkt#S512 Confirmation Method

   RFC 9449 [RFC9449] defines the jkt confirmation method member for
   binding access tokens to a DPoP public key using a SHA-256 JWK
   Thumbprint [RFC7638].

   This document defines an analogous confirmation method member
   jkt#S512 that uses SHA-512 as the hash algorithm:

   jkt#S512:  The value is the base64url encoding of the JWK Thumbprint
      [RFC7638] computed using SHA-512 of the DPoP public key (in JWK
      format) to which the access token is bound.

   When using jkt#S512, the Authorization Server computes the SHA-512
   JWK Thumbprint of the DPoP public key and includes the result as the
   jkt#S512 member of the cnf claim in the access token (for JWT access
   tokens) or associates it with the token for later retrieval via token
   introspection [RFC7662].

   The Resource Server MUST compute the SHA-512 JWK Thumbprint of the
   DPoP public key and compare it with the jkt#S512 value in the cnf
   claim.  If the values do not match, the Resource Server MUST reject
   the request.

   The choice of jkt#S512 over jkt is a deployment decision.  It can be
   configured out of band or by the Authorization Server using the
   Resource Server's metadata (Section 6.2.3).

   [[TODO: Section 3.1 of [RFC7800] does not preclude the presence of
   both jkt and jkt#S512 in the same cnf claim.  Including both would
   not represent confirmations for two different keys but rather two
   different hash confirmations of the same key.  This may actually be
   useful during a transition period in possible future non-constrained
   deployment scenarios.  The working group should determine whether to
   prohibit or allow this.]]

6.2.2.  ath#S512 Access Token Hash

   RFC 9449 [RFC9449] defines the ath claim in the DPoP proof JWT as the
   base64url-encoded SHA-256 hash of the ASCII encoding of the access
   token value.

   This document defines an analogous claim ath#S512 that uses SHA-512
   as the hash algorithm:

   ath#S512:  The value is the base64url encoding of the SHA-512 hash of
      the ASCII encoding of the associated access token's value.

   [[TODO: Including both ath and ath#S512 in the same DPoP proof JWT
   would not represent hashes of two different access tokens but rather
   two different hash confirmations of the same access token.  This may
   actually be useful during a transition period in possible future non-
   constrained deployment scenarios.  The working group should determine
   whether to prohibit or allow this.]]

   The Resource Server MUST compute the SHA-512 hash of the ASCII
   encoding of the access token value and compare it with the ath#S512
   value in the DPoP proof JWT.  If the values do not match, the
   Resource Server MUST reject the request.

   A Resource Server MAY signal the acceptable access token hash methods
   by including the ath_methods parameter in the WWW-Authenticate: DPoP
   challenge.  The value of ath_methods is a space-delimited list of
   access token hash claim names that the Resource Server supports,
   analogous to the algs parameter defined in Section 7.1 of [RFC9449].
   When ath_methods is absent, the Client MUST use ath.  When
   ath_methods is present, the Client MUST use one of the listed
   methods.  Additionally, Resource Server metadata for the supported
   access token hash methods is defined in Section 6.2.3.

   The following is a non-normative example of an HTTP response
   signalling the client to use ath#S512:

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: DPoP algs="Ed25519", ath_methods="ath#S512"

6.2.3.  Resource Server Metadata

   This document defines the following Resource Server metadata
   parameters [RFC9728]:

   dpop_confirmation_methods_supported:  JSON array containing the DPoP
      confirmation method names that the Resource Server supports.
      Defined values are jkt and jkt#S512.  If omitted, the default is
      ["jkt"].

   dpop_access_token_hash_methods_supported:  JSON array containing the
      access token hash claim names that the Resource Server supports.
      Defined values are ath and ath#S512.  If omitted, the default is
      ["ath"].

7.  Security Considerations

   The S512 code challenge method provides the same structural security
   properties as S256.  It is a one-way transformation of the code
   verifier that prevents an attacker who intercepts the authorization
   code from computing the code verifier needed to exchange it for
   tokens.

   The x5t#S512 confirmation method provides the same structural
   security properties as x5t#S256 defined in [RFC8705].

   The jkt#S512 confirmation method, dpop_jkt combined with
   dpop_jkt_method parameter, and ath#S512 claim provide the same
   structural security properties as their SHA-256 counterparts defined
   in DPoP [RFC9449].

   SHA-512 provides a 256-bit collision resistance and 512-bit preimage
   resistance, exceeding the 128-bit and 256-bit levels provided by SHA-
   256.  The use of SHA-512 is suitable for deployments with elevated
   security requirements.

   Deployments that do not have restrictions on use of SHA-256 do not
   need to migrate away from the established SHA-256 based mechanisms.
