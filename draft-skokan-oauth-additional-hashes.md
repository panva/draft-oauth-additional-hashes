--- abstract

This document defines SHA-512 as an additional hash algorithm for
OAuth 2.0 Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), mutual-TLS
certificate-bound access tokens, and Demonstrating Proof of
Possession (DPoP), for use in deployments operating under security
policies that prohibit the use of SHA-256, which is otherwise
mandated or the only option in these mechanisms.

# Introduction

Several OAuth 2.0 mechanisms exclusively mandate the use of SHA-256:
Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) {{RFC7636}}, mutual-TLS
certificate-bound access tokens {{RFC8705}}, and Demonstrating Proof
of Possession (DPoP) {{RFC9449}}.

Security policies, such as the US Commercial National Security
Algorithm (CNSA 2.0) Suite {{cnsafaq}}, prohibit the use of SHA-256 and
require SHA-384 or SHA-512. This prevents the deployment of these
OAuth 2.0 mechanisms in such environments.

This document addresses this gap by defining SHA-512 alternatives
for each of these mechanisms, for use in deployments operating
under such constrained policies. For PKCE, a new `S512` code challenge
method is defined. For mutual-TLS certificate-bound access tokens,
a new `x5t#S512` confirmation method is defined. For DPoP, this
document defines SHA-512 alternatives for the JWK Thumbprint
confirmation method (`jkt#S512`) and the access token hash claim
(`ath#S512`), as well as an extensible framework for
authorization code binding and access token hash algorithm
negotiation.

\[\[TODO:
([#1](https://github.com/panva/draft-oauth-additional-hashes/issues/1))
The hash algorithm chosen by this document is currently SHA-512.
The working group should determine whether to define SHA-384 or
SHA-512.\]\]


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

All references to "CNSA 2.0" in this document refer to CNSA 2.0
{{cnsafaq}}, unless stated otherwise.


# Purpose and Scope

The sole purpose of this document is to enable deployments operating
under security policies that prohibit SHA-256 to use PKCE,
mutual-TLS certificate-bound access tokens, and DPoP. In such
constrained
deployments, the SHA-512 alternatives defined herein are used in
place of their SHA-256 counterparts, since those deployments cannot
use SHA-256 at all.

This document does not deprecate the SHA-256 based methods defined
in existing specifications. The SHA-256 based methods remain the
widely deployed, interoperable and recommended defaults for all
mechanisms addressed by this document. Deployments that are not
subject to such security policies SHOULD NOT offer or use the
SHA-512 based methods defined herein.

The negotiation mechanisms defined herein may however facilitate a
broader transition away from SHA-256 in the future, should that
become necessary.


# PKCE

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) {{RFC7636}} defines `plain` and
`S256` as code challenge methods, with `S256` being the only method
that applies a
cryptographic hash to the code verifier. The specification
establishes the "PKCE Code Challenge Methods" registry, which this
document uses to register the `S512` code challenge method.

## `S512` Code Challenge Method {#S512}

This document defines a new code challenge method for use with
PKCE {{RFC7636}}. The client creates a code challenge derived from
the code verifier by using the following transformation on the code
verifier:

S512:
: code_challenge = BASE64URL(SHA-512(ASCII(code_verifier)))

The server-side verification of the code verifier follows
{{Section 4.6 of RFC7636}}, using SHA-512 as the hash algorithm.

## Authorization Server Metadata {#as-metadata}

An Authorization Server that supports the `S512` code challenge
method MUST advertise its support in its Authorization Server
metadata (e.g., {{RFC8414}} or {{OpenID.Discovery}}) by including
`S512` in the `code_challenge_methods_supported` metadata parameter
value as defined in {{RFC8414}}.


# Mutual-TLS {#mtls}

OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound
Access Tokens {{RFC8705}} exclusively uses SHA-256 for
certificate-bound access tokens via the `x5t#S256` confirmation
method. No alternative hash algorithms or extension points for hash
algorithm negotiation are defined. This document defines the
`x5t#S512` confirmation method and a Resource Server metadata
parameter for negotiating the confirmation method.

## `x5t#S512` Confirmation Method {#x5t-S512}

RFC 8705 {{RFC8705}} defines the `x5t#S256` confirmation method
member for binding access tokens to a client certificate using a
SHA-256 hash of the DER-encoded X.509 certificate.

This document defines an analogous confirmation method member
`x5t#S512` that uses SHA-512 as the hash algorithm:

x5t#S512:
: The value is a base64url-encoded SHA-512 hash of the
  DER encoding of the X.509 certificate.

When using `x5t#S512`, the Authorization Server computes the
SHA-512 hash of the client certificate presented during mutual-TLS
and includes the result as the `x5t#S512` member of the `cnf`
claim in the access token (for JWT access tokens) or associates
it with the token for later retrieval via token introspection
{{RFC7662}}.

The Resource Server MUST compute the SHA-512 hash of the client
certificate presented during mutual-TLS and compare it with the
`x5t#S512` value in the `cnf` claim. If the values do not match,
the Resource Server MUST reject the request.

The choice of `x5t#S512` over `x5t#S256` is a deployment decision.
It can be configured out of band or by the Authorization Server
using the Resource Server's metadata ({{mtls-rs-metadata}}).

\[\[TODO:
([#2](https://github.com/panva/draft-oauth-additional-hashes/issues/2))
{{Section 3.1 of RFC7800}} does not preclude the presence of
both `x5t#S256` and `x5t#S512` in the same `cnf` claim.
Including both would not represent confirmations for two
different keys but rather two different hash confirmations of
the same certificate. This may actually be useful during a
transition period in possible future non-constrained deployment
scenarios. The working group should determine whether to
prohibit or allow this.\]\]

## Resource Server Metadata {#mtls-rs-metadata}

This document defines the `mtls_confirmation_methods_supported`
Resource Server metadata parameter {{RFC9728}}. Its value is a JSON
array containing the mutual-TLS confirmation method names that the
Resource Server supports. Defined values are `x5t#S256` and
`x5t#S512`. If omitted, the default is `["x5t#S256"]`.


# DPoP

OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) {{RFC9449}}
exclusively uses SHA-256 for all of its hash
operations: the `jkt` confirmation method, the `ath` access token
hash claim, and the `dpop_jkt` authorization code binding parameter.
No alternative hash algorithms or extension points for hash
algorithm negotiation are defined.

{{Section 11.10 of RFC9449}} anticipated the need for hash algorithm
agility and foresaw that a future specification would define a new
confirmation method, JWT claim, and authorization request parameter
for use as alternatives to their SHA-256 counterparts. This document
defines those DPoP mechanisms: the `dpop_jkt_method` authorization
request parameter, the `jkt#S512` confirmation method, and the
`ath#S512` JWT claim. In constrained deployments where SHA-256 is
prohibited, these are used in place of their SHA-256 counterparts
rather than alongside them.

## Authorization Code Binding Methods

### `dpop_jkt_method` Authorization Request Parameter {#dpop-jkt-method}

RFC 9449 {{RFC9449}} defines the `dpop_jkt` authorization request
parameter as the JWK Thumbprint {{RFC7638}} of the DPoP public key
using SHA-256. This document changes the definition of `dpop_jkt`
to allow alternative hash algorithms indicated by the
`dpop_jkt_method` parameter.

This document defines the `dpop_jkt_method` authorization request
parameter, sent alongside `dpop_jkt`, to indicate the hash algorithm
used to compute the JWK Thumbprint. The following method values are
defined:

S256:
: JWK Thumbprint {{RFC7638}} using SHA-256, as originally
  defined in {{Section 10 of RFC9449}}.

S512:
: JWK Thumbprint {{RFC7638}} using SHA-512.

For backwards compatibility, when `dpop_jkt_method` is absent from
the authorization request, the Authorization Server MUST assume the
value `S256`.

The value of `dpop_jkt` MUST be computed using the hash algorithm
indicated by `dpop_jkt_method`.

### Authorization Server Metadata {#dpop-as-metadata}

This document defines the `dpop_jkt_methods_supported` Authorization
Server metadata parameter. Its value is a JSON array containing the
`dpop_jkt_method` values that the Authorization Server supports.

An Authorization Server that supports `dpop_jkt_method` values
beyond `S256` MUST advertise its support by including the supported
values in the `dpop_jkt_methods_supported` metadata parameter.


## SHA-512 Hash Algorithms

### `jkt#S512` Confirmation Method {#jkt-S512}

RFC 9449 {{RFC9449}} defines the `jkt` confirmation method member
for binding access tokens to a DPoP public key using a SHA-256
JWK Thumbprint {{RFC7638}}.

This document defines an analogous confirmation method member
`jkt#S512` that uses SHA-512 as the hash algorithm:

jkt#S512:
: The value is the base64url encoding of the JWK
  Thumbprint {{RFC7638}} computed using SHA-512 of the DPoP
  public key (in JWK format) to which the access token is bound.

When using `jkt#S512`, the Authorization Server computes the
SHA-512 JWK Thumbprint of the DPoP public key and includes the
result as the `jkt#S512` member of the `cnf` claim in the access
token (for JWT access tokens) or associates it with the token
for later retrieval via token introspection {{RFC7662}}.

The Resource Server MUST compute the SHA-512 JWK Thumbprint of
the DPoP public key and compare it with the `jkt#S512` value in
the `cnf` claim. If the values do not match, the Resource Server
MUST reject the request.

The choice of `jkt#S512` over `jkt` is a deployment decision. It
can be configured out of band or by the Authorization Server using
the Resource Server's metadata ({{dpop-rs-metadata}}).

\[\[TODO:
([#2](https://github.com/panva/draft-oauth-additional-hashes/issues/2))
{{Section 3.1 of RFC7800}} does not preclude the presence of
both `jkt` and `jkt#S512` in the same `cnf` claim. Including
both would not represent confirmations for two different keys
but rather two different hash confirmations of the same key.
This may actually be useful during a transition period in
possible future non-constrained deployment scenarios. The
working group should determine whether to prohibit or allow
this.\]\]

### `ath#S512` Access Token Hash {#dpop-ath}

RFC 9449 {{RFC9449}} defines the `ath` claim in the DPoP proof JWT
as the base64url-encoded SHA-256 hash of the ASCII encoding of the
access token value.

This document defines an analogous claim `ath#S512` that uses
SHA-512 as the hash algorithm:

ath#S512:
: The value is the base64url encoding of the SHA-512 hash of
  the ASCII encoding of the associated access token's value.

\[\[TODO:
([#2](https://github.com/panva/draft-oauth-additional-hashes/issues/2))
Including both `ath` and `ath#S512` in the same DPoP proof JWT
would not represent hashes of two different access tokens but
rather two different hash confirmations of the same access
token. This may actually be useful during a transition period
in possible future non-constrained deployment scenarios. The
working group should determine whether to prohibit or allow
this.\]\]

The Resource Server MUST compute the SHA-512 hash of the ASCII
encoding of the access token value and compare it with the
`ath#S512` value in the DPoP proof JWT. If the values do not
match, the Resource Server MUST reject the request.

A Resource Server MAY signal the acceptable access token hash
methods by including the `ath_methods` parameter in the
`WWW-Authenticate: DPoP` challenge. The value of `ath_methods` is a
space-delimited list of access token hash claim names that the
Resource Server supports, analogous to the `algs` parameter defined
in {{Section 7.1 of RFC9449}}. When `ath_methods` is absent, the
Client MUST use `ath`. When `ath_methods` is present, the Client
MUST use one of the listed methods. Additionally, Resource Server
metadata for the supported access token hash methods is defined in
{{dpop-rs-metadata}}.

The following is a non-normative example of an HTTP response
signalling the client to use `ath#S512`:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: DPoP algs="Ed25519", ath_methods="ath#S512"
~~~

### Resource Server Metadata {#dpop-rs-metadata}

This document defines the following Resource Server metadata
parameters {{RFC9728}}:

dpop_confirmation_methods_supported:
: JSON array containing the DPoP confirmation method names
  that the Resource Server supports. Defined values are `jkt`
  and `jkt#S512`. If omitted, the default is `["jkt"]`.

dpop_access_token_hash_methods_supported:
: JSON array containing the access token hash claim names
  that the Resource Server supports. Defined values are `ath`
  and `ath#S512`. If omitted, the default is `["ath"]`.


# Security Considerations

The `S512` code challenge method provides the same structural
security properties as `S256`. It is a one-way transformation of
the code verifier that prevents an attacker who intercepts the
authorization code from computing the code verifier needed to exchange
it for tokens.

The `x5t#S512` confirmation method provides the same structural
security properties as `x5t#S256` defined in {{RFC8705}}.

The `jkt#S512` confirmation method, `dpop_jkt` combined with
`dpop_jkt_method` parameter, and `ath#S512` claim provide the same
structural security properties as their SHA-256 counterparts
defined in DPoP {{RFC9449}}.

SHA-512 provides a 256-bit collision resistance and 512-bit preimage
resistance, exceeding the 128-bit and 256-bit levels provided by
SHA-256. The use of SHA-512 is suitable for deployments with elevated
security requirements.

Deployments that do not have restrictions on use of SHA-256
do not need to migrate away from the established SHA-256 based
mechanisms.
